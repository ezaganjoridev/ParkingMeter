# ParkingMeter EECS3461 / CSE3461 - Graphical User Interfaces

A simple parking meter GUI for EECS3461


In collaboration with Richmond Frimpong, Daniyal Javed we were able <br />
to create an interface for parking meters that include <br />
-> A welcome screen with click to touch <br />
-> A Main page with student number and pin for validation <br />
-> an email page where input is optional <br />
-> An insruance page which checks the users input and validates it <br />
Please feel free to use for educational purposes only. <br />
