# ParkingMeter EECS3461 / CSE3461 - Graphical User Interfaces

A simple parking meter GUI for EECS3461

In collaboration with Richmond Frimpong, Daniyal Javed we were able
to create an interface for parking meters that include
-> A welcome screen with click to touch
-> A Main page with student number and pin for validation
-> an email page where input is optional
-> An insruance page which checks the users input and validates it

Project was finished October 15th, 2015
