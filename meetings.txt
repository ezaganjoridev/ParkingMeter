    ---------------------
    Special Requirements: (optional)
    ---------------------
    To use the new syntax available in Java 8, I have to set the 
    compliance level of my code to 1.8.
    Specifically the class used called 'Optional<>' uses compliancy 1.8

    -------
    Design:
    -------

    The motivation behind desigining this software came from a group
    project assigned by Prof. Scot Mackenzie. After deciding on how 
    we were going to tackle this project and started working on a 
    base model, we looked at current parking systems and what we did 
    not like about them, and incorperated it in our project as much as
    we could. We went after a very simplistic design that is very easy
    to use, color schemes that are very simplistic. We made our automated
    parking system simulate York Universitys and used images that belong to
    the university. Our color scheme was after york univeristies in the sense
    red and white, but we added black and blue keyboard because it looks very
    nice on the white background. 

    --------------------
    Additional Features: (optional)
    --------------------

    We provided an Email page that was not a requirement. This is to sign
    a student up to news letters and offers provided by the university. 
    
    We designed a Pay Balance button if student has arrears.
